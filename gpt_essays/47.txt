"Annabel Lee" by Edgar Allan Poe is a poignant narrative poem that delves deep into the themes of love, loss, and eternal devotion through the use of various literary devices. This essay will analyze how Poe's strategic use of these devices enhances the poem's emotional depth and thematic complexity.

### Title

The title "Annabel Lee" immediately sets a personal and intimate tone for the poem. By using a name, Poe frames the narrative around a specific individual, inviting readers into a deeply personal story of love and loss. The singularity of the name suggests a uniqueness and irreplaceability of the love shared with Annabel Lee, preparing the reader for a narrative that is as much about the specificity of personal loss as it is about the universal experience of love.

### Paraphrase

"Annabel Lee" narrates the story of two lovers whose bond was so strong that it invoked the envy of celestial beings. The narrator reminisces about his love, Annabel Lee, who lived in a kingdom by the sea. Despite their young age, they loved with a passion beyond their years, a love that the narrator believes was so intense that it led to Annabel Lee's death, caused by the jealousy of angels. Even after her death, the narrator's love for Annabel Lee remains undiminished, as he spends his nights lying beside her tomb by the sea, highlighting the themes of eternal devotion and the enduring nature of true love even in the face of loss.

### Connotation

Poe's use of connotative language throughout "Annabel Lee" enriches the poem's emotional and thematic layers. For instance, the repetition of the phrase "kingdom by the sea" evokes a fairy-tale-like setting, contrasting the idyllic love story with the harsh reality of Annabel Lee's death. The use of supernatural elements, such as the envy of the angels and demons, introduces a contrast between the earthly and the divine, suggesting that the love between the narrator and Annabel Lee transcends the mortal realm. This use of metaphors and supernatural imagery serves to elevate their love, making it something ethereal and unattainable, yet also cursed and doomed.

### Attitude/Tone

The tone of "Annabel Lee" is deeply melancholic and reflective, with a touch of defiance. Poe's choice of words conveys the narrator's profound love and sorrow, as well as his bitterness towards the forces that separated them. The tone shifts from a nostalgic reminiscence of their love to a more somber and haunting mood as the narrator describes lying beside Annabel Lee's tomb. This shift underscores the transformation of love from a living, breathing experience to a memory that haunts the present.

### Shifts

The poem shifts from a celebration of love to a lamentation of loss, and finally, to a declaration of eternal devotion. Initially, the narrator fondly recalls the days of love with Annabel Lee, but the narrative soon turns to the tragedy of her death. In the final stanzas, the focus shifts to the narrator's unwavering love and devotion, as he lies beside her tomb. These shifts in perspective and content highlight the complexity of love as both a source of immense joy and profound sorrow.

### Theme

The central themes of "Annabel Lee" revolve around the duality of love as both a source of happiness and pain, and the idea of eternal devotion in the face of loss and separation. Poe explores how love transcends the physical realm, enduring beyond death. The literary devices employed throughout the poem—such as the use of connotative language, supernatural imagery, and shifts in tone—serve to deepen the exploration of these themes, portraying love as an all-consuming force that not only brings joy but also sorrow, yet remains unbreakable even in the face of death.

In conclusion, Edgar Allan Poe's "Annabel Lee" masterfully employs various literary devices to explore the themes of love, loss, and eternal devotion. Through its connotative language, shifts in tone, and the use of supernatural elements, the poem delves into the complexities of love, portraying it as a powerful, transcendent force that endures beyond the grave. Poe's narrative not only captures the depth of personal loss but also celebrates the enduring nature of true love, making "Annabel Lee" a timeless ode to love's eternal power.
