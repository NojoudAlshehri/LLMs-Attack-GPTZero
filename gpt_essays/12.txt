Title: The Urgency of Addressing Racial Injustice in Modern Society

Introduction:
In today's society, it is evident that certain individuals enjoy more privileges than others, leading to the marginalization of certain groups based on race, ethnicity, and social class. This essay aims to shed light on the issue of racial discrimination and its impact on individuals, particularly within the criminal justice system. Drawing inspiration from Bryan Stevenson's book, "Just Mercy," and recent events such as the tragic killing of George Floyd, it becomes clear that racial injustice persists and demands urgent attention.

Body:

1. The Experience of Unjust Treatment:
One personal encounter with racial discrimination involved witnessing an African American woman being denied entry into a restaurant for unknown reasons. This incident left me feeling anxious and highlighted the need to address racial discrimination. No individual should be subjected to mistreatment based on their race, emphasizing the significance of combating racial discrimination in the modern world.

2. Racial Bias in the Criminal Justice System:
The criminal justice system, designed to protect and serve all individuals, often fails to be inclusive and fair. Minorities and those who do not conform to societal norms frequently face unequal treatment within this system. Stevenson's book highlights the vulnerability of certain groups and his efforts to bring justice to those unjustly incarcerated. It is evident that the system is inherently biased against minorities, leading to unnecessary suffering without justifiable cause.

3. The George Floyd Case:
The killing of George Floyd serves as a prominent example of the systemic racial injustice prevalent in society. The footage of his murder evoked feelings of pain and rage, highlighting the long-standing mistreatment of Black individuals. The powerlessness experienced by witnesses and George himself underscores the urgent need for action against racial injustice.

4. Moving Beyond Non-Racism to Anti-Racism:
The Black Lives Matter movement has taught us that being non-racist is insufficient; we must actively become anti-racist. Silence can be interpreted as consent, necessitating the fulfillment of our moral obligations to those suffering from racial injustice. This entails engaging in meaningful conversations, supporting relevant causes, being conscious consumers, and advocating for policy changes. Stevenson's book echoes this call for rational consideration of each criminal case, the elimination of bias, and the provision of assistance to those in need.

5. The Imperative for Action:
The events of the past year have made it impossible to ignore the suffering endured by marginalized communities. We are duty-bound to respond, as ignorance and inaction have no place in addressing racial injustice. Empathy must be combined with action to effect change. Despite the prevalence of recorded incidents, law enforcement personnel are rarely held accountable for excessive use of force. The lack of accountability has sparked a widespread demand for justice, emphasizing the urgency of addressing racial injustice.

Conclusion:
The persistence of racial discrimination in modern society necessitates immediate action. By sharing personal experiences, reflecting on Bryan Stevenson's book, and examining recent events, it becomes evident that racial injustice remains a pressing issue. It is our responsibility to unlock our empathy and translate it into meaningful action. Only through collective efforts can we dismantle systemic racism and create a more just and equitable society for all.
