Throughout history, the establishment of law enforcement has been driven by the need to protect citizens and maintain order within society. The primary goal of law enforcement is to ensure the safety, well-being, and possession of individuals, while also safeguarding them from civil disorder and criminal activities. This notion is supported by Harris (2020), who highlights that law enforcement has been granted lawful powers, including the use of force sanctioned by the government and the ability to make arrests through a monopoly on violence.

In its early stages, law enforcement was often carried out by clan members who joined forces to enforce the rules of the group on any rogue members. The underlying purpose of this enforcement was to protect the community from individuals who posed a threat to its harmony and security (Harris, 2020). The community firmly believed that any act of violence against one of its members was an attack on the entire group. Therefore, the fundamental features of early law enforcement included the absence of coercion, a wide range of tasks for law enforcement, and a clear distinction between those legally responsible for policing and those who carried out the actual duties.

In modern times, peace officers are entrusted with the responsibility of upholding the law and ensuring the safety of the public. They are bound by the laws of their respective jurisdictions, both on and off duty, to refrain from committing any criminal acts (Schroeder & Lombardo, 2018). For instance, in the United States, peace officers are required to adhere to local and state laws and are prohibited from knowingly engaging in criminal behavior. Additionally, peace officers are expected to comply with the rules and procedures governing criminal investigations, such as those related to detention, arrests, evidence preservation, and the use of informants (Schroeder & Lombardo, 2018). It is crucial that peace officers do not exceed their authority when enforcing the law and that they do not infringe upon the individual freedoms of citizens.

However, there are instances where police officers may be permitted to deviate from the rule of law in certain criminal procedures. These exceptions are typically made in situations where the law enforcement officer is acting in the best interest of public safety or to prevent harm to individuals. Nevertheless, these exceptions should be carefully regulated and monitored to ensure that they are not abused or used as a means to infringe upon the rights of individuals.

In conclusion, the establishment of law enforcement throughout history has been driven by the need to protect citizens, maintain order, and prevent criminal activities. Early law enforcement relied on clan members who enforced the rules of the group, while modern law enforcement is carried out by peace officers who are entrusted with upholding the law and ensuring public safety. It is essential that peace officers adhere to the laws and regulations governing their jurisdiction, refrain from committing crimes, and respect the individual freedoms of citizens. While there may be exceptions to the rule of law in certain circumstances, these exceptions should be carefully monitored to prevent any abuse of power.
