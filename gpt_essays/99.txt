Kenneth Burke's dramatistic pentad offers a powerful lens through which to analyze and interpret human actions and motivations within texts, including visual texts like photographs. By dissecting Jeff Wall's photograph titled "The Thinker" through the elements of the pentad—agent, act, scene, agency, and purpose—we can uncover the nuanced layers of meaning and motivation behind the depicted scene. Additionally, considering the viewer's focus and the contextual backdrop of the photograph's title, which references Auguste Rodin's famous sculpture, enriches our understanding of the actor's motivation within the photograph.

### Agent

In "The Thinker," the agent is the individual depicted in the photograph. This person is not just a subject but an actor within a narrative constructed by Wall. The agent's identity, including their appearance, expression, and posture, becomes a critical element in interpreting their motivation. The reference to "The Thinker" suggests a contemplative or reflective state, inviting viewers to speculate about the depth and nature of the agent's thoughts.

### Act

The act refers to what the agent is doing. In this case, the act is thinking, or at least the appearance of being in deep thought. The act of thinking, especially when tied to the title's allusion to Rodin's sculpture, suggests a profound engagement with internal or external issues. The nature of these issues remains ambiguous, allowing for varied interpretations based on the viewer's perspective and the additional elements of the pentad.

### Scene

The scene encompasses the environment or context within which the act takes place. Wall's composition, lighting, and choice of setting all contribute to the scene's mood and help frame the agent's act of thinking. The scene can influence our interpretation of the agent's motivation, suggesting whether the thinking is introspective, inspired by the surroundings, or perhaps even imposed by the scene's conditions.

### Agency

Agency in Burke's pentad refers to the means by which the act is carried out. In the context of "The Thinker," the agency could be interpreted as the agent's own mind and body. The posture reminiscent of Rodin's sculpture, the focus in the eyes, and the potential use of objects or the absence thereof in the photograph all contribute to how the act of thinking is executed. The agency highlights the internal resources and capacities the agent draws upon to engage in the act.

### Purpose

Purpose is the goal or reason behind the act. With the title "The Thinker," one might infer that the purpose is to solve a problem, contemplate life, or engage in creative or philosophical thought. The purpose, while suggested by the other elements of the pentad, is ultimately speculative and shaped by the viewer's interpretation.

### Viewer's Focus and Contextual Information

The viewer's focus and the additional contextual information provided by the photograph's title play significant roles in interpreting the actor's motivation. The title's reference to Rodin's sculpture primes the viewer to approach the photograph with certain expectations about the depth and seriousness of the agent's thoughts. This intertextual connection enriches the viewer's engagement with the photograph, inviting comparisons between the timeless contemplation embodied by the sculpture and the contemporary scene captured by Wall.

### Interaction of the Pentad's Elements

The interaction of the pentad's elements in "The Thinker" demonstrates how different interpretations of the same scene can emerge. For instance, if one emphasizes the scene and the agent's isolation within it, the motivation might be interpreted as a forced introspection due to external circumstances. Alternatively, focusing on the act and the agency might suggest a more voluntary, self-driven exploration of ideas or emotions. The purpose inferred can vary widely, from existential questioning to a more focused problem-solving endeavor, depending on how the elements are weighted and connected.

In conclusion, applying Kenneth Burke's pentad to Jeff Wall's "The Thinker" not only facilitates a deeper understanding of the actor's motivation within the photograph but also illustrates the complexity of interpretation. The interaction of the pentad's elements, influenced by the viewer's focus and contextual information, underscores the dynamic nature of meaning-making in visual texts. Through this analysis, we see how the dramatistic pentad can be a valuable tool in unraveling the layers of human action and motivation captured in the art of photography.
