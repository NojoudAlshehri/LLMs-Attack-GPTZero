The decline of the 14-15th centuries, also known as the crisis of the late Middle Ages, refers to the recession processes that took place in some countries of Western Europe. Western historians have focused on the “crisis phenomena” in the European economy during this period, particularly the movement of prices, population decline, and the abandonment of cultivated lands. The decline was also characterized by the formation of centralized states in France and England, the introduction of firearms, and the decline of chivalry.

One of the main factors contributing to the decline was the demographic decline. The late Middle Ages saw a decrease in population due to the plague epidemic, famine, and numerous wars. Harsh weather conditions and unsuitable soil for planting crops also contributed to the decline. The Great Famine, in particular, led to widespread starvation and even cannibalism. The plague, which killed millions of people, spread rapidly throughout Europe, causing panic and anarchy. The fear of getting sick led to the forced isolation of anyone suspected of being infected.

The decline also led to social unrest, with peasants rebelling against the nobles. The poor viewed the aristocracy's luxurious lifestyle as fraudulent, leading to increased violence between the two classes. Wars such as the War of Roses, Hundred Years’ War, and Polish-Teutonic Wars further devastated the European territory, causing political, economic, and social dissonance.

Despite the decline, the Middle Ages were a time of cultural and intellectual development. Religion played a central role in medieval society, with the Church eradicating heresy and repressing religious sects. However, the Church's influence weakened in the 14th century, leading to the development of independent centralized states. The revival of interest in ancient literature and the invention of printing contributed to the spread of knowledge and the development of art and sciences.

Italian humanists, such as Francesco Petrarch, played a significant role in the cultural development of the period. They believed that eternal truths were hidden in the poetic fiction of ancient literature and emphasized ethics and human dignity. The New Testament also played a crucial role in shaping faith and providing solace during the crisis. The Catholic faith spread by people, and the New Testament served as a source of faith formation and prayer.

In conclusion, the crisis of the late Middle Ages had devastating consequences for Europe, but it also led to cultural formation. The decline was driven by various factors, including the plague, famine, and conflicts. However, it also gave rise to the development of centralized states, the spread of knowledge, and the revival of ancient literature. Religion played a significant role in providing solace and shaping cultural and intellectual development during this period.
