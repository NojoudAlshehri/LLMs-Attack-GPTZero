Sociology is a field of study that examines social strata based on various criteria such as race, age, education, and socioeconomic status. Among these criteria, socioeconomic status is particularly emphasized in modern sociology as it plays a significant role in shaping social inequalities. However, I believe that the intersection of social strata with race and access to medical care is the most intriguing and relevant topic in sociology today. By exploring these areas, sociology sheds light on the underlying causes of social phenomena, including inequality, and provides valuable insights for society.

One of the ways sociology investigates these issues is by identifying correlations between certain events or characteristics that sociologists observe in their studies. These correlations serve as the foundation for creating statistical and demographic charts, which in turn enable sociologists to make sociological forecasts, including those related to public health. By having comprehensive information about public health and inequality, it becomes possible to develop tailored approaches to education and employment that take into account these factors.

For instance, sociologists have found a correlation between the level of education obtained at a young age and the likelihood of developing certain illnesses in adulthood. Moreover, the specific field of education also correlates with the prevalence of certain diseases. Individuals educated in programming or cybersecurity, for example, are less likely to experience health problems compared to those educated in music. Even if these individuals exhibit similar health indicators and complaints at the age of 20, the divergence becomes apparent as they age. This is because the physical demands of musical education during adolescence can have long-term effects on the body.

Similar correlations can be drawn between other fields of study and health outcomes. For example, individuals pursuing careers in archeology or accounting may face different health challenges compared to those in industrial chemistry or psychology. Adler and Ostrove (1999) support this notion, stating, "We find effects of education acquired through young adulthood on health problems that emerge many years later, suggesting that educational attainment is determining later health" (p. 8). Therefore, the choice of profession not only determines one's role in society and available resources but also influences the susceptibility to certain diseases.

Sociological research also reveals that certain forms of cancer are more prevalent among individuals from lower socioeconomic strata. Adler and Ostrove (1999) describe this finding, stating, "Research in Canada reveals that the association of SES with survival is strongest for cancers of the head and neck region, uterus and cervix, and bladder. These are cancers in which local symptoms often antedate development of metastatic disease and allow early treatment" (p. 9). Individuals with lower social status are less likely to seek medical attention, often resorting to self-medication or seeking advice from friends and neighbors. Additionally, they may have limited access to quality screenings, especially if they reside in small towns or face financial constraints.

These examples illustrate how sociology can establish correlations and draw parallels to make informed forecasts. By analyzing medical data from individuals across different socioeconomic strata and building extensive databases, modern sociologists can identify current trends in the healthcare sector. However, socioeconomic status alone does not solely determine health outcomes. Another crucial aspect that partially influences socioeconomic status is the ecological conditions of the environment in which people live. Environmental issues have become a prominent area of socioeconomic research, as they significantly impact health.

Living in ecologically clean areas can positively contribute to overall health, even for individuals with lower levels of education or limited job skills. On the other hand, individuals with high socioeconomic status who reside in polluted cities may experience health issues that are not typically associated with their social class and environment. Those with higher socioeconomic status often have the means to travel and relocate, allowing them to mitigate the negative effects of environmental factors. Climate change, for instance, may even enhance their physical endurance and well-being.

In conclusion, sociology plays a crucial role in understanding social strata and their impact on various aspects of life, including health. By identifying correlations and drawing parallels between socioeconomic status, race, access to medical care, and environmental factors, sociology provides valuable insights into the causes and consequences of social inequalities. This knowledge enables individuals and policymakers to make informed decisions that can shape their lives and promote better health outcomes for all.
