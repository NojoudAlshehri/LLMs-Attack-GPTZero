One forward-looking approach_path that has emerged in this context is the Contribution-Based Incentive mock_up (CBI), which introduces a new theoretical_account for doc compensation. In the post-COVID-19 era, where patients are increasingly seeking personalized and convenient care options, such as telehealth services, the CBI Model's adaptability is particularly pertinent. By scrutinizing the model's adaptability, impact on revenue generation, tone measures, and patient-centric care, as well as its suitability to the evolving healthcare landscape, this analysis aims to illuminate the CBI Model's potential_difference to enhance healthcare delivery in the post-COVID-19 era.

### Aligning Physician Incentives with Healthcare Objectives
